The `tests` directory supports all testing functionality for the project. It is organized into two subdirectories:

- [`model/`](model/) - Model testing (see below).
- [`unit/`](unit/) - Unit tests for shared source code under [`src/`](../src/).

---

## Model Testing

> **TODO:** Model testing is not yet implemented. The [`model/`](model/) subdirectory is reserved for forthcoming tests that exercise the trained classifiers (logistic regression, XGBoost, neural network) against held-out data and reproducibility benchmarks.

---
