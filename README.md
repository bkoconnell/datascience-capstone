## Project Background

Gunshot residue (GSR) analysis is a critical component of forensic investigations involving firearm discharge. When a firearm is fired, microscopic particles containing elements such as lead (Pb), barium (Ba), and antimony (Sb) are released and can serve as key physical evidence in criminal cases. Traditional GSR identification relies on scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), where expert analysts classify particles based on morphology and elemental composition.

However, this process is prone to error. Chemically similar particles from environmental sources, such as brake dust, fireworks, and industrial materials, can produce false positives, while atypical GSR compositions may lead to false negatives. Since interpretation depends heavily on expert judgment, consistency and reproducibility across analyses remain concerns, particularly in high-stakes legal contexts.

Machine learning offers a data-driven alternative that can improve the consistency, scalability, and transparency of GSR classification. Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on model accuracy and efficiency, this project emphasizes interpretability and failure analysis. Understanding *why* models make decisions and *where* they fail is essential for responsible application in forensic science.

## Research Questions

1. **Primary:** How accurately and reliably can machine learning models distinguish true gunshot residue particles from chemically similar non-GSR particles?
2. **Comparative:** How does classification performance vary across different machine learning approaches (linear, tree-based, neural network) when applied to GSR identification?
3. **Interpretability:** Which elemental features and combinations contribute most strongly to model predictions, and how consistent are feature importance patterns across models?
4. **Failure Analysis:** Under what conditions do models misclassify particles, particularly false positives where environmental particles are incorrectly labeled as GSR, and what does this reveal about the limitations of automated classification?

## Hypotheses & Predictions

### Hypotheses

- Machine learning models can effectively distinguish true GSR particles from environmental confounders, with performance depending on algorithm choice and the underlying chemical characteristics of particles.
- Non-linear models (e.g., gradient-boosted trees, neural networks) will outperform linear models (e.g., logistic regression) due to complex interactions among elemental features.
- Particles lacking the classic Pb-Ba-Sb signature are more likely to be misclassified as false negatives, while chemically similar confounders such as brake dust will drive higher false positive rates.

### Predictions

- Non-linear models will outperform the logistic regression baseline across accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC, though hyperparameter tuning will be necessary to reduce false positive rates for chemically ambiguous particles.
- Feature importance analyses (e.g., SHAP, permutation importance) will identify lead, barium, and antimony — and their ratios — as the most influential predictors, especially in borderline classifications.
- Misclassifications will concentrate among particles with elemental profiles that partially overlap with the Pb-Ba-Sb signature, highlighting edge cases that would benefit from additional expert review rather than fully automated classification.

## Stakeholders
 
Our primary stakeholder is the __National Institute of Justice (NIJ)__, but this research impacts a range of other stakeholders across the forensic science and criminal justice landscape. Here are some research beneficiaries:
 
- **Crime laboratories and law enforcement agencies** (e.g., FBI Laboratory, ATF, state police crime labs) who would benefit from faster, more consistent GSR classification tools that reduce analyst workload and inter-examiner variability.
- **Standards and metrology bodies** (e.g., NIST, ENFSI) with an interest in developing validated, reproducible benchmarks for forensic particle analysis.
- **Legal and public defense organizations** (e.g., the Innocence Project, public defender offices) who have a stake in understanding false positive rates and model limitations, given the role forensic evidence plays in wrongful convictions.
- **Federal research funders** (e.g. NSF) who actively support research aimed at improving the scientific rigor of forensic methods.
 
## Data
 
This project uses two complementary datasets. View the compressed [raw data parquet files](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/tree/main/data/raw).
 
### NFI Gunshot Residue Dataset (Matzen et al., 2022)
[NFI readme](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/blob/main/data/raw/NFI/NFI.md)
- **Source:** Netherlands Forensic Institute ([GitHub](https://github.com/NetherlandsForensicInstitute/gunshot-residue))
- **Contents:** SEM/EDS particle measurements with expert-assigned relevance classes across four relational tables (stub, particle, source, stub_source)
- **Size:** 2,801,667 particles across 90 elemental composition columns from 210 criminal cases and 63 R&D projects
- **Role in this project:** Primary dataset for ML training and evaluation. Particles are labeled as GSR (1,078,946), Non-GSR (1,216,039), or Ambiguous (506,682) based on their merged relevance class, validated against NIST ground truth.

### NIST Gunshot Residue Dataset (Ritchie & Reynolds, 2021)
[NIST readme](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/blob/main/data/raw/NIST/NIST.md)
- **Source:** National Institute of Standards and Technology ([DOI: 10.18434/mds2-2660](https://www.nist.gov/glossary-term/38706))
- **Role in this project:** Used to validate NFI particle class labels by confirming which classes represent true GSR vs environmental confounders.
- **Files used:**

| File | Category | Particles | Data Available |
|------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Shooter #1 - Zero time.zip | GSR (shooter hands) | 3,462 | Per-particle class labels from MLLSQ_maxParticle.csv |
| Shooter #2 - Zero time.zip | GSR (shooter hands) | 3,429 | Per-particle class labels from MLLSQ_maxParticle.csv |
| Sparklers post handling post burn.zip | Fireworks confounder | -- | HDZ class definitions only (no per-particle CSV) |
| Spinners - Post-ignition.zip | Fireworks confounder | -- | HDZ class definitions only |
| Roman Candles - Post-handling, pre-ignition.zip | Fireworks confounder | -- | HDZ class definitions only |
| Ford Explorer Rear Driver.zip | Brake dust confounder | -- | HDZ class definitions only |

- **Key finding:** NIST shooter samples confirmed that PbBaSb, PbBa, PbSb, and BaSb classes are genuine GSR. NIST confounder samples (fireworks, brake dust) lack GSR particle classes, confirming these are true environmental sources. This informed the labeling scheme applied to the NFI dataset.

### Labeling Scheme (NIST-Informed)

| NFI Class | Label | NIST Justification |
|-----------|-------|--------------------|
| PbBaSb | GSR | NIST: Classic GSR (GSR.0, GSR.1, GSR.2) |
| PbBa | GSR | NIST: GSR.Pb-Ba |
| PbSb | GSR | NIST: GSR.Pb-Sb |
| BaSb | GSR | NIST: GSR.Ba-Sb |
| BaAl, BaCaSi | Non-GSR | No NIST GSR equivalent |
| CuZn | Non-GSR | NIST: Brass -- environmental, not GSR |
| ZnTi, Hg, TiZnGd, GaCuSn | Non-GSR | Environmental particles |
| Pb, Ba, Sb, Sr | Ambiguous | Single-element -- could be GSR fragment or environmental |

## Methods

### Preprocessing
- Merged 14 NFI particle files with corrected headers (files 2–14 lacked column names)
- Applied NFI documentation merging rules to consolidate relevance classes
- Assigned NIST-informed binary labels (GSR vs Non-GSR)
- Identified 90 elemental composition columns as features
 
### Models
| Model | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Linear | Baseline classifier to establish a performance floor |
| XGBoost | Tree-based (nonlinear) | Capture complex feature interactions |
| Fully Connected Neural Network | Deep learning (tabular) | Test deep learning on structured elemental data |

All hyperparameter tuning will be oriented toward minimizing false positives while maintaining low false negatives. Dimensionality reduction (PCA for linear space, UMAP for nonlinear space) will be explored selectively on the NFI elemental features (Ac–Zr), but only where it does not compromise interpretability.
 
### Evaluation
- **Classification metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and Precision-Recall AUC (to account for expected class imbalance)
- **Specificity focus:** False positive rate is central — incorrectly labeling a non-GSR particle as GSR represents a critical failure mode
- **Confusion matrices:** Used extensively to investigate misclassification patterns
- **Validation:** Cross-validation across folds; cross-dataset validation (train on NFI, test on NIST) to assess real-world generalizability
 
### Interpretability
- **Feature importance:** SHAP values and permutation importance to quantify the influence of elemental concentrations and ratios on predictions
- **Integrated gradients:** Probe neuron activation based on input features in neural network models
- **Spectral contribution:** Analyze contribution scores for spectral peaks in image-derived features
- **Goal:** Transform traditionally "black box" models into interpretable tools suitable for forensic contexts
 
### Misclassification Analysis
- Identify patterns in elemental composition or spectral features that drive false positives and false negatives
- Pay particular attention to chemically similar particles and edge cases that warrant expert review
- Inform both model limitations and practical forensic implications of automated GSR classification

## Testing & Source Code

### Model Testing

The latest model releases are found here: [artifacts/models/](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/tree/main/artifacts/models).

Pre-designed tests for the latest model releases are available in `tests/model/`.

> **TODO: Write model tests. Then add steps here for running the Model Tests. Include the latest test results for each model.**

### Test Automation (GitHub Actions CI)

CI runs on every pull request to `main` (and on manual dispatch) via GitHub Actions in [.github/workflows/](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/tree/main/.github/workflows/). The pipeline is composed of the following jobs:

- **Python Lint** ... Runs `py_lint.py`, which uses the Ruff formatting tool against the repo's .PY files. Fails the CI job if any file is not format-compliant and uploads the proposed diff as a build artifact.

- **Notebook Lint** ... Runs `nb_lint.py` (Ruff formatting tool via [nbQA](https://nbqa.readthedocs.io/)) against .IPYNB files. Fails the CI job if any file is not format-compliant and uploads the proposed diff as a build artifact.

- **Import-Position Lint** ... Checks every .PY and .IPYNB file for imports that appear after non-import code. Fails the CI job and uploads a Markdown report of the offending imports as a build artifact. See [docs/github_actions/linting.md](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/tree/main/docs/github_actions/linting.md).

- **Unit Tests** ... Runs the `pytest` suite under `tests/unit/` against a freshly installed environment (`pip install -r requirements.txt` + editable install of the project package).

Manually triggered CI jobs:
- **Notebook Validation** *(Reproducibility)* [not released] ... Users can manually trigger this workflow using a PR Label to either run all notebooks in the project (in parallel) or run only the notebooks that are in the **changed files** for the PR.

>**TODO: Link to latest Reproducibility report from the `validate` testing (GitHub CI) w/ Screenshot of all notebooks passing**

### Local Testing

**Lint (auto-format)** ... Apply ruff formatting to every `.py` and `.ipynb` file via the `lint.sh` / `lint.bat` wrapper, then commit the diff. See [docs/linting.md](docs/linting.md).

**Lint (import position)** ... Check that every `import` sits at the top of its file. No auto-fix. Review the report and move any offending imports manually. See [docs/linting.md](docs/linting.md).

**Model tests** ... Not released yet ... Will run predefined tests from `tests/model/`. See [docs/testing.md](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/blob/main/docs/testing.md).

**Unit tests** ... Run the pytest suite under `tests/unit/`. See [docs/testing.md](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/blob/main/docs/testing.md). (NOTE: You must complete steps 1 & 2 from the [QuickStart](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/blob/main/docs/QuickStart.md) guide for developer env setup *before* running the tests).

**Validate Notebooks (*reproducibility*)** ... Not released yet ... but this script can be run locally to validate our notebooks.

>**TODO: Link to latest Unit Test report from the `unit test` job (GitHub CI) w/ Screenshot of all tests passing**

### Source Code / Custom Functions

> **Prerequisite:** You must complete steps 1 & 2 from the [QuickStart](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/blob/main/docs/QuickStart.md) guide for developer env setup.

The `src` directory contains reusable code to support notebook exploration & project reproducibility.

The `utils` directory replicates many of the custom functions originally used in our notebooks. The authors are credited, and docstrings are included with usage details.

> NOTE: As of 5/8/2026, we haven't incorporated the `src` code into our notebooks, but the plumbing is there and fully functional. To import code from `src` into a notebook, review the usage examples in [docs/DEVELOPER_SETUP.md](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPER_SETUP.md). After developer setup, you can also run the unit tests which confirm our custom functions work.

See [src/SOURCE.md](https://github.com/bkoconnell/datascience-capstone/blob/main/src/SOURCE.md) for additional details.
